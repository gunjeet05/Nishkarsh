Generics
1.Generics are the thing which allow us to write the component which are reusable and which can work for variety of types 

We use generics over any because using it we can specify relationship between two things hence it provide more type safety.


We can have multiple types 




Generic function 

const converToArray<T>(val:T):T[]=>{
    return [T];
}



Example1:-
We want to write a function which will accept a props of type React.ComponentType 

const parentComponent: React.FC<{component:React.ComponentType}>({component}){
    return <component />

}

Sometimes we need to make the component more reusable by extending the type.

For example I was having a prop which was a component but it was not accepting the classname props to make it accept classname props we can do the following thing 

const ParentComponent:React.FC<{Component : REact.FC<React.SVGProps<SVGVGElement>>}>;
